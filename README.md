# node-iso
My attempt at an isomorphic Node application with React and React-Router. It will serve as boilerplate for future applications that I may need to write in Node in the future.

It uses the following technologies:

* EJS
* Express
* Browserify
* React
* React-Router
* Bower (to get Bootstrap CSS)
* Gulp (to compile all the files and start the server)

As you can see, a very barebones project.

# How to run the app
Clone the repo and run: `gulp`

This will build all of the files, parse JSX, transpile ES6, create browserify bundles, etc.
